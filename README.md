This repository explores how to push your deep learning model to the limits with little data. In particular, I look at model architecture, data augmentation and pseudo-labeling.

You can read more about the approach I take [here](...).

To run the code:
1. `cd` into the cloned repository
2. Download the [dogs vs cats](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats) dataset manually or if you have the kaggle-cli configured, run `kg download`
3. Run `unzip train.zip` from the root of the repository
4. Run the notebook
